<h1>Hey, I'm YongQuan(John)! ​ </h1>

I'm a third year software engineering student at University of Alberta.
Currently I'm seeking for Co-op job opportunity for Winter term of 2021.

The first program I wrote was an Arduino program for a spider robot with
distance sensor. My interests include self-driving vehicle, machine learning
and communication protocols.
